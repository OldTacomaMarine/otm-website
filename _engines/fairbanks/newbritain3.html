<p>The Quinebaug Valley Engineers Association operates the Zagray Farm Museum, which owns a Fairbanks-Morse 32E14 that powered a water pump at the New Britain Water Works.</p>
<p>This engine and another (the four-cylinder model <a href="newbritain4.html">here</a>) were installed in 1938 and ran alternators that powered water pumps for fire control.  They operated continuously until shortly after WWII.  They were removed in 2004 during a renovation of the facility, and are now part of the museum collection.  The museum plans to put the four-cylinder model back in operation as a demonstration in the near future.
