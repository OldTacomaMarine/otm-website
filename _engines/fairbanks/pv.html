<p>The Historic Prairie Village has a Fairbanks-Morse Y-model diesel engine on display.</p>
<p>According to OTM Inc's sources, this engine started life as a Y-VA, and the piston and head were changed to direct injection parts from a 32C or later engine, as the air transfer passage between the lower base and the upper base/air valve does not bolt to the lower base. Only the Y-model semi diesel engines were rated at 50 hp, and all of those have bolts attaching the air passage to the lower base. The model Y engines also had a 7 inch crank and the Y-VA had an 8 inch crank in all bearings to withstand doubling the compression. </p>
