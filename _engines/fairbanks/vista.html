<p>This engine was manufactured in 1922 and shipped to Alaska, then to Catalina Island California, then to Arizona as a stationary generator supplying power to smelting operations in Quartzsite.</p>
<p>In 1983, it was donated to the Vista California Antique Gas &amp; Steam Engien Museum and restored to operating condition by volunteers.  This engine and others are started up during the museum's annual shows in June and October.</p>
