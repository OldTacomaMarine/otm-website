<p>This engine was one of two 1930s Y models from a private power plant for a tobacco magnate's estate on Sapelo Island, Georgia.  It generated power until the 1960s, then sat idle for about 30 years with many of the original tools and parts nearby.</p>
<p>In Summer 2006, the two Y models and a 1950s opposed-piston Fairbanks-Morse were removed by Elden DuRand and Frank Luecke and donated to the Ashtabula County Antique Engine Club.  The other Y-model went to the <a href="sapelo1.html">East Tennessee Crank-Up</a>.</p>
<p>A volunteer crew in Ohio have been working hard on the engine and have built a spacious shed and mount for it, and re-attached the flywheel and crankshaft.</p>
