<p>The silver mining ghost town of Cody, BC has a model 32E14 Fairbanks-Morse among the ruins of the Noble Five Mine.  This site is one of many in the region; the nearby <a href="silversmith.html">Silversmit Power &amp; Light Corporation Museum</a> has a 2-cylinder Y-model Fairbanks-Morse, as well.</p>
<p>The Noble Five mine was reportely founded in the 1880s and operated until the 1940s, when a "devastating" fire put an end to the operations.  Many of the buildings are still extant, including the mine's concentrator, and the site is a popular destination for hikers seeking to explore ruins.</p>
