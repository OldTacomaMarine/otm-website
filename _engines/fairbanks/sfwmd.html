<p>This engine powered a pump on the canals surrounding Lake Okeechobee in Central Florida.  It was installed in a pumphouse in the 1940s and used until retirement on May 28, 1991.</p>
<p>The engine is now on display at the John Stretch Park in Lake Harbor, Florida.  It is connected to the pump it once powered (also manufactured by Fairbanks-Morse) and installed with interpretive material as part of the water district's historic pump display.</p>
