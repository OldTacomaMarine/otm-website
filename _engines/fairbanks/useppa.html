<p>The Useppa Island Historica Society owns a two-cylinder Y model Fairbanks-Morse.  It was used to provide power to Useppa Island residents before they were connected to the mainland electrical grid.</p>
<p>The American Society of Mechanical Engineers recognizes the Useppa engine as a significant example of an "early high-compression, cold-start, full-diesel engine developed in the United States for isolated or rural power generation machinery before widespread electrification was available."</p>
