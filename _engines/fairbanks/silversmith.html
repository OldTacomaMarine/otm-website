<p>The Silversmith Power Station has a three-cylinder Fairbanks-Morse on display at in the historic silver-rush town of Sandon, British Columbia.  The original engine was installed in 1917 to supplement the hydro-electrical generators during low times; it seized and was scrapped in the 1950s.</p>
<p>The engine currently on display at Silversmith was salvaged from either Taylor, BC or Jasper, AB, and installed in 1994.  It is not currently operational; however, the station's hydro-electric generators continue to produce electricity for the small tourist town of Sandon.</p>
