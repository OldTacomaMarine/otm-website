<p>The sternwheel tugboat <i>Barbara H</i> is powered by a four-cylinder Fairbanks-Morse diesel engine.</p>
<p>The tug was originally built as a gasoline-powered boat named the <i>Standard</i> for the Standard Oil Company of Ohio in 1922.  In 1925, the gasoline engine was replaced with a Fairbanks-Morse 35B8-1/2 diesel engine, which powered the tug until 1940.  Under new owners, the tug was renamed the <i>Donald B</i> and repowered with a Fairbanks-Morse 35E10 diesel engine.  It was an active tugboat moving barges on the Ohio River until 2000, when it was retired as the longest working towboat.</p>
