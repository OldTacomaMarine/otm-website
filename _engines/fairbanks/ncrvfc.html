<p>The New Centerville &amp; Rural Volunteer Fire Company has a 1925 Fairbanks-Morse Y-model that powered the grinder in the Somerset Feedmill from 1925 to 1968.  It was restored by Mel Bailey and Friends of the Fire Co over a seven-year period.</p>
<p>According to OTM Inc's sources, this engine had been converted to direct injection.</p>
