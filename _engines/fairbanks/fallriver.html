<p>The Estes Park Museum operates the historic Fall River Hydroplant, which retains its original model Y Fairbanks-Morse diesel engine.  It was installed in the hydroplant in 1930, and was probably used elsewhere before coming to Fall River.  The engine is connected to an electrical generator, also manufactured by Fairbanks-Morse.</p>
<p>The Fall River Hydroplant installed a second stationary diesel engine in 1935, a six-cylinder Fairbanks-Morse.  This engine was removed sometime in the mid-1940s and its fate is unknown.
