<p>The <i>Catalyst</i> was the University of Washington's first purpose-built oceanographic research vessel.  Its Washington Iron Works engine has remained in continuous operation since installated in May 1932 and still powers the boat through Southeast Alaska on passenger charters.</p>
<h3>Engine Modifications</h3>
<p><ul>
<li> the injector tips are Washington-style on the outside and Atlas-Imperial-style on the inside</li>
<li> the fuel pressure regulator has an Atlas-Imperial seat and stem -- inferior to the reversible Washington design</li>
<li> the new valves are one-piece</li>
<li> the valve cages have new noses and are not one piece</li>
<li> the guides are off the shelf (likely from MAN) </li>
<li> the rod bearing nuts are nylock and not "large profile" </li>
<li> the clutch guide pins are two piece</li>
<li> the pneumatic shifting has been replaced with hydraulic</li>
</ul></p>
