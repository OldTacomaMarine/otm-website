<p>The Wasington Iron Works engine that powers the yarder in the Roots Collection was manufactured in 1928.  It was one of about 27 engines that powered logging equipment in the Pacific Northwest, and was used by Simpson Logging Co. in Shelton, WA until the 1960s.  It was donated in 1992 to the Roots of Motive Power Collection in Willits, CA, where it is on public display. </p>
