<p>Five years after the Foss Launch and Tug Company purchased the steam tug <i>Wallowa</i>, they rebuilt her from the hull up into a modern diesel tug.  Renamed the <i>Arthur Foss</i> after the 1934 conversion, the rebuilt tug was powered by one of the largest Washington Iron Works diesel engines ever built.  With six 18" x 24" cylinders that generated between 700 and 900 horsepower, the engine made the <i>Arthur</i> one of the most powerful tugs on the West Coast.  </p>
