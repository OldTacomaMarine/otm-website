<p>The fishboat <i>New Zora</i>, likely a cannery tender, was powered by a Washington Iron Works diesel engine installed in May 1935.  Original records list the owner of the vessel as Anton Zorich and later Burke Canning Company.</p>
<p>The engine was removed from the <i>New Zora</i> in 1965 and placed in a storage shed and not disturbed until the end of 2009.  The engine was reassembled in 2021 by John, but it has not yet been run.</p>
