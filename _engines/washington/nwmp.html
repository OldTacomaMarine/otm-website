<p>This engine was destined to be installed in a vessel but never made it there.  Still in its wooden crate, the engine sat in different owners' storage areas until recently, when the Northwest Museum of Propulsion purchased it.  Until the Museum first ran it, its only operation had been a test on the Washington Iron Works factory floor.</p>
