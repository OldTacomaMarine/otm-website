<p>When Seattle entrepreneur Horrace McCurdy's Puget Sound Bridge &amp; Drydock Company built three yard tugs for the US Navy, they were powered by Washington Iron Works engines.  Though the tug has changed from the <i>YTB-361</i> to the <i>Roland Foss</i> to the <i>Donald R</i> to the <i>Chippewa</i>, the engine has remained the same.</p>
