<p>This engine once powered a generator.  The Waterfall Cannery also used three <a href="/engines/atlas/index.html">Atlas-Imperial</a> engines (<a href="/engines/atlas/waterfall1.html">#1</a>, <a href="/engines/atlas/waterfall2.html">#2</a>, and <a href="/engines/atlas/waterfall3.html">#3</a>) to power generators, which still reside beside the Washington.</p>
