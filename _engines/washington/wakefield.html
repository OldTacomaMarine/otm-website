<p>The former crab-processing plant in Port Wakefield, Alaska, has a Washington diesel engine in one of its abandoned buildings.  The town of Port Wakefield was largely abandoned following the 1964 earthquake, with the processing plant relocated to Port Lions.</p>
<p>The engine was likely installed in the plant during the 1940s or 1950s.  It is a marine model, manufactured before 1936, and likely powered a fishboat before coming to Wakefield.</p>
