<p>The tugboat <i>Maris Pearl</i> (ex-<i>Santana</i>, ex-<i>Sea Fox</i>) is powered by a DMQ-8 Enterprise diesel engine.  The tug is now used as a yacht to cruise Puget Sound and other Pacific Northwest waters.  Its owner enjoys the low-speed engine for how quiet and pleasant it is for cruising. </p>
