<p>The tugboat <i>Nash</i> (LT-5) is powered by a DMQ-8 Enterprise diesel engine.  The tug is the only remaining vessel to have participated in the D-Day invasion of Normandy during World War II. It was fully restored by the H. Lee White Maritime Museum and is open to the public for tours during the summer months</p>
