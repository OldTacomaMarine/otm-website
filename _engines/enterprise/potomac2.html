<p>The <i>Potomac</i> is powered twin DMG-6 Enterprise diesel engines.  This Coast-Guard cutter turned presidential yacht turned warship turned derelict turned museum ship was originally powered by Winton diesels.  During restoration, the Enterprise diesels were installed as the closest engines to the originals available.</p>
