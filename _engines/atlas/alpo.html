<p><i>Alpo</i> was built in 1943 as <i>ST-335</i> with orders to go to Normandy. Being one of the few boats surviving the war, the boat went on to icebreaking for the town Oulu. In 1951, the name changed to <i>Alpo</i> and an ice breaker bow was installed. <i>Alpo</i> cleared ice in Port Toppila until 1990. Then in 1999 it became a museum boat owned by private company Toppilan Möljä Oy with some partnership with the town of Oulu and maritime enthusiast volunteer group Merikaupunni Ry for crewing.</p>

<p><i>Alpo</i> sailed to the 60th D-Day anniversary at Normandy in 2004 and now have the ambitious goal of attending the 80th anniversary in Normandy in 2024.</p>

<p>The Finnish language website for the <i>Alpo</i> is <a href="https://www.merikaupunni.fi/">www.merikaupunni.fi</a>.</p>
