<p>When the Star and Crescent Boat Company in San Diego built the <i>Palomar</i> in 1926, they installed a 240 hp Fairbanks-Morse diesel engine that propelled the tug around the waters of Southern California until 1946.  The Pacific Tow &amp; Salvage company of Long Beach bought the tug from the War Shipping Administration after World War II and repowered her with an Atlas-Imperial.  The Foss Maritime Company acquired ownership of Pacific Tow &amp; Salvage in 1950 and transferred the <i>Palomar</i> to its Bellingham Tug &amp;Amp; Barge division.  The Foss Company later transferred the tug to its own colors, renaming her <i>Lorna Foss</i>, the second vessel to hold that name.  Decommissioned in 1969, her next owners renamed her the <i>Searchmaster</i> and used her for cruises, charter, and exploration.</p>
<p>Tacoma-based tugboat operator and diesel mechanic Keith Sternberg bought the tug in 1979 and restored the name <i>Palomar</i>.  The tug has changed owners since, but remains a favorite in the Puget Sound retired tugboat and antique engine communities.  </p>
