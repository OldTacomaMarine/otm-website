<p>This engine was donated to the Harbor History Museum in the early 2000's.  It was previously owned by Bates Technical College in Tacoma, Washington, where it was restored by student Adrian Lipp.</p>
<p>After consulting with shipwright Michael Vlahovich, the Harbor History Museum plans to install the engine in its historic vessel <i>Shenandoah</i> as an appropriate example of a period engine.</p>
