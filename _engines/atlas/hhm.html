<p>This engine was donated to the Harbor History Museum in the early 2000's.  It was previously owned by Bates Technical College in Tacoma, Washington, where it was restored by student Adrian Lipp.</p>
<p>In 2021 the Harbor History Museum installed the engine in its historic vessel <i>Shenandoah</i> as an appropriate example of a period engine.</p>
