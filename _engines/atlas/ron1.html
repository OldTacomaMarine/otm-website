<p>This engine was purchased from a trade school to power the tugboat-yacht <i>Vigorous II</i>.  After it was removed from the <i>Vigorous</i> in Maple Bay, British Columbia, it was sold as a "parts" engine to a ferryboat on the Sacramento River Delta, which was powered by an engine of the same model.  Following a catastrophic failure aboard the ferryboat, both the <i>Vigorous II</i>'s engine and the ferry's engine were sold to collector and salvager Ron Braznell, who has restored both engines.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this engine is an Atlas-Heaps engine; during WWII, the Atlas-Imperial Company licensed its designs to be used and manufactured by the Heaps Engineering Company of Vancouver, Canada.  The Atlas-Heaps are nearly identical to Atlas-Imperials, save that their crankshafts, for reasons now unknown, are 1/8" to 6-1/4" larger than those in the Atlas-Imperial models, making replacement of main bearings at times problematic.</p>
