<i>Merikarhu</i> was built in 1943 as <i>ST-79</i> and joined the Normandy landing. It spent the next few years clearing mines from the Gulf of Finland. In 1951 the town of Hamina bought the boat and renamed it Merikarhu, which translates to Ice Bear. The town used it to clear ice from the harbor for 37 years. Once it retired, a group of maritime professionals continued to maintain the boat. They formed a historical society to help interpret the ship's history with publications and opened the boat for tours. You can see the boat next to the S/S Hyoky maritime museum in Hamina.
