<p>The <i>Elmore</i> may have the distinction of being powered by a record number of engines in its lifespan.  It received the very first diesel engine produced by <a href="../washington/index.html">Washington Iron Works</a> after its conversion from a steam tug.  It then went through two more Washington engines.</p>
<p>Its current Atlas-Imperial diesel engine is from the fishing vessel <i>Alaska</i>.</p>
