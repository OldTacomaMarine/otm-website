<p>The former crab-processing plant in Port Wakefield, Alaska, has an Atlas-Imperial diesel engine in one of its abandonned buildings.  The engine was likely installed in the 1940s or 1950s, and may have been used in a fishboat prior to that.  The town of Port Wakefield was largely abandonned following the 1964 earthquake, with the processing plant relocated to Port Lions.</p>
