<p>The <i>Gowanus Bay</i> is powered by a late-model Atlas-Imperial diesel engine.</p>
<p>The tug was built in 1956 in Florida as an Army "ST" tug, designated ST-2201 <i>Falmouth</i>, and later named <i>Linda</i>.  It was renamed again to <i>Gowanus Bay</i> and is now a favorite at New York vintage boat shows.</p>
