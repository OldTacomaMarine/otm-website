Fairbanks-Morse model numbers are a combination of three different
designations: design year, letter designation, and bore size. Design year is
the year that the design was implemented ('32, '33, '37, etc). Letter
designations include A for a flapper-type blower, E, F and Y for a crank-case
air scavenging system, and D for a piston-type blower. For example, a 32E14 is
an engine designed in 1932 with a crank case air scavenging system and a
14-inch bore.
