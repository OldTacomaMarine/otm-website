After the expiration of Rudolf Diesel's American license in 1912, Fairbanks Morse entered the large engine business.
The company's larger Model Y semi-diesel became a standard workhorse, and sugar, rice, timber, and mine mills used the engine.
The model Y was available in sizes from one through six cylinders, or 10 to 200 horsepower.
The Y-VA engine was the first high-compression, cold-start, full diesel developed by Fairbanks Morse.

The company expanded its line to the marine CO engine (Many 100 H.P. CO marine engines were used in the Philippine Islands to power ferry boats) as well as the mill model E, a modernized Y diesel.
From this, Fairbanks-Morse became a major engine manufacturer and developed plants for railway and marine applications.
