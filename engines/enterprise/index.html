<p>
Enterprise model numbers are a combination of three different letter
designations: "D" (diesel), "M" (marine), or "S" (stationary), and a
designation that indicates the cylinder size (M, W, G, Q, etc). These three
letter designations are followed by the number of cylinders in the model. For
example, a DMQ-8 is a marine diesel engine with a 16" bore, 20" stroke, and
eight cylinders.
