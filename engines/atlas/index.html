Atlas-Imperial model numbers are a combination of four different designations:
cylinder number, block type, application, and cylinder volume.  Block types
were either "H" heavy-duty engines with individual cylinders and heads; or "E"
en-block engines with a solid block and individual heads.  Application could be
"M" (marine), "S" (stationary), or "N" (industrial).  Cylinder volume is the
cubic volume in inches of a single cylinder. For example, a 4HM763
Atlas-Imperial is a marine heavy-duty diesel with four cylinders and a volume
of 763 cubic inches per cylinder.
